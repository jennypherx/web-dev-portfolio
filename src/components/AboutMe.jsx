        <p>
        In my college journey, I have developed a strong interest in software development and web design. 
        My major, Computer Graphics and Imaging, has afforded me the opportunity to explore various aspects of the design and technology industry. 
        I've had the privilege of working on projects in the graphic design, software development, 
        and web development areas. These are the showcased works in my portfolio.
